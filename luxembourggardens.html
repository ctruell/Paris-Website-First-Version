		<p class="par" id="one">The Luxembourg Gardens or Le Jardin du Luxembourg was built to compliment the palace of King Henry IV's widow who was Italian so the gardens are influenced by the Italian Baroque period. In 1612 the construction of the garden began with the planting of 2000 elm trees. Originally the garden was a eight hectares. The garden was expanded in 1630 when another 30 hectares were purchased. Jacques Boyceau de la Barauderie the gardener of the Tuileries and the palace of Versailles was hired to work on the garden. The garden was abandoned after Henry IV was no longer king and part of it was even sold for housing in 1780. The garden was expanded by adding 40 hectares after the French Revolution. Today the garden is very popular place for French and tourists to visit.</p>
