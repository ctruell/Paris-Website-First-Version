		<p class="par" id="one">The Tuileries Gardens named after the tile factories that stood there before the gardens. In 1564 Queen Catherine de Medici built the Palais des Tuileries and gardens. In 1664 the gardens were landscaped by the famous gardener Andr&eacute; Le N&ocirc;tre to the landscape they have today. Many tourists and French visit the Tuileries Gardens. The summer is an especially great time to visit since the F&ecirc;te des Tuileries is ongoing so there are trampolines and rides such as a ferris wheel (the festival is great I've been there).</p>
		<p class="par">Closest Metro stops: Tuileries (Line 1), Concorde (Lines 1, 8 and 12), Pyramides (Line 7 and Line 14)</p>
