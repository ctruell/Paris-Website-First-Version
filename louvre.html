		<p class="par" id="one">The Louve was originally designed as a fortress in 1190 to protect Paris. Though it is at the heart of the city today it was originally at the outer limts of the city. It was also a prison for the enemies of the French. The louvre was rebuilt in the mid-1500s Francois I wanted kings to live there. Right before the Revolution the French government was forced to move to Paris. After the war Napoleon I lived there. During this time many interior updates where happenng. After the government left the louvre it faced some difficulties such as the the purchase of a fake tiara in 1896 and the theft of the Mona Lisa in 1911. Now the museum is thriving and hugely popular.</p>
